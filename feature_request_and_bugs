bugs:
- check control+z and control + Y
- check dichroic
- check multiplayer
- refraction at interfaces is not always correct (side of refractive index does not change with rotation)
- beam splitter color sometimes purple
- beam splitter rotation is going there

-  On saving File "/Users/amenssen/Documents/git/optiverse/src/optiverse/ui/views/main_window.py", line 1366, in open_assembly
    M = MirrorItem(MirrorParams(**d))
TypeError: MirrorParams.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'locked'
zsh: abort      optiverse

- QWP seems to adjust polarisation correctly but PBS does not reflect correctly in the pbs + qwp + backreflector mirror config. 

feature request:
- zemax black box model
- isolator
- beam block
